If asked to add new photos, then use `https://picsum.photos/` photos.

You make sure all pages have a good blend of:
* Lots of Shortcode Element usage
* Photos in a variety of formats such as thumbnail, hero, gallery, etc
* Award-Winning Designs
* Dynamic Elements like drop-down, accordion, toggle, slideshow, etc
* Call to Actions to other pages that may be relevant or important to the page you're creating
* Always responsive
* Proper Usage of tables, lists, and the option to print important elements
* Any amazing element you think will enhance this from Bootstrap UI
* Any usage you desire from Elegant Font
* Any usage you desire from Magnific Popup
* Do not add any new styling - use global styles that are already set only.  You can call up any style that you think exists that would be standard with bootstrap or that you see available from the shortcode sample page provided.

You can use any of the shortcodes available for this HTML static site to optimize the pages. Here is a sample page that shows our bootstrap layout, proper nav menu and footer, and also all the possible shortcodes:
